TODO
	Bugs
		Fix H/GDMA?
		Fix sound bugs ****************************************************************************************************
			mostly affects channel 1, some sounds are wrong
			do high notes sound out of pitch? YES: interpolation needed
			fix the never ending noise bug (when daisy turns into bug)
		Fix the strange sound stop + crash bug: obtain core dump when this next occurs
		Fix time allocated to CPU and timer
		Fix DAA instruction
		Fix HALT instruction
			halts until an interrupt is received, even if they are disabled: they are just not serviced (i believe)
		Implement STOP instruction
		Initialise sound/graphics data properly!
		Find out why some of the demos dont work properly
		Fix weird slow downs
	Rewrites
		the SDL_Delay() calling code is bad: needs to work on a FPS basis?
		most of the sound code is pretty badly designed tbh
	Implementation
		serial hack
		MBC3 real time clock
		Implement display off feature: the absense of this causes lots of problems: DONE (I HOPE)
		Sprite ordering
		State save/load DONE (mostly)
		Pause: stops sound! DONE
		Nice scaling algorithms (hqx, etc)
		Debugger: bit instructions
		Simple disassembler:
		Gameboy Color support IN PROGRESS
		UI
		Joystick support
		internal GB and GBC rom support
		settings/config file
	Nice extras
		video/sound file output
		speed adjustment
		dump tiles
		
	Check behaviour on real hardware
		Sound 
			sweep/envelope function
		Display
			How LY=LCY coincidences are dealt with


display cache rewrite

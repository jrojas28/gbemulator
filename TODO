TODO
	Bugs
		Fix H/GDMA?

		Find out why some of the demos dont work properly
		Fix weird slow downs
		Fix slight graphical inaccuracies: sprites not lining up exactly with background?

		MBC3 real time clock
		Implement display off feature: the absense of this causes lots of problems: DONE (I HOPE)
		Sprite ordering
		State save/load DONE (mostly)
		Pause: stops sound! DONE
		Nice scaling algorithms (hqx, etc)
		Debugger: bit instructions
		Simple disassembler:
		Gameboy Color support IN PROGRESS
		UI
		Joystick support
		internal GB and GBC boot rom support
		settings/config file
	Nice extras
		video/sound file output
